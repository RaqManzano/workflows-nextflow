# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Summary

This lesson introduces Nextflow, a workflow management system, focusing on its application in bioinformatics and data analysis. It is designed for researchers and students in computational biology and related fields. The workshop covers the basics of Nextflow, including writing and running workflows, managing dependencies, and ensuring reproducible data analysis. The lesson materials are open-source, hosted on GitHub, and follow the interactive, hands-on teaching style of The Carpentries.

# Statement of Need

<!-- explain how the submitted artifacts contribute to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be adopted by others. -->

Nextflow addresses the growing need for efficient workflow management in complex data analysis, particularly in fields like bioinformatics. This lesson helps researchers and students to learn essential Nextflow skills, enabling them to streamline their data analysis workflows, improve reproducibility, and collaborate effectively. The module is designed to be accessible to beginners with some command line and programming experience.



<!--  describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in teaching and learning situations. -->

# Learning Objectives, Design, and Experience

The module's learning objectives include:

- Understanding the principles of workflow management with Nextflow.
- Developing skills to write, execute, and debug Nextflow workflows.
- Understanding of nf-core community nextflow pipelines.


The design incorporates practical exercises, discussions, and challenges, aligning with The Carpentries' teaching philosophy. The materials encourage active learning and peer-to-peer interaction, making the workshop engaging and effective.



* Describe the submission, and explain its eligibility for JOSE.

# How the Lesson Came to Be

The development of this module was motivated by the growing popularity of Nextflow[ditommaso2017nextflow] and nf-core[ewels2020nfcore] in bioinformatics and the lack of comprehensive, beginner-friendly resources. 

We aimed to fill this gap by adapting, with permission, [training materials](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nextflow-tutorial) from [seqera](https://seqera.io) into a Carpentries-style lesson within the UKRI-funded Ed-DaSH project.

Drawing on existing Carpentries materials and the experience of the author(s) in computational biology, the module was iteratively developed and refined based on learner feedback.
