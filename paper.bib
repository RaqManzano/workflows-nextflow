  abstract = "Yeast cell factories encounter physical and chemical stresses
              when used for industrial production of fuels and chemicals. These
              stresses reduce productivity and increase bioprocess costs.
              Understanding the mechanisms of the stress response is essential
              for improving cellular robustness in platform strains. We
              investigated the three most commonly encountered industrial
              stresses for yeast (ethanol, salt, and temperature) to identify
              the mechanisms of general and stress-specific responses under
              chemostat conditions in which specific growth rate-dependent
              changes are eliminated. By applying systems-level analysis, we
              found that most stress responses converge on mitochondrial
              processes. Our analysis revealed that stress-specific factors
              differ between applied stresses; however, they are underpinned by
              an increased ATP demand. We found that when ATP demand increases
              to high levels, respiration cannot provide sufficient ATP,
              leading to onset of respirofermentative metabolism. Although
              stress-specific factors increase ATP demand for cellular growth
              under stressful conditions, increased ATP demand for cellular
              maintenance underpins a general stress response and is
              responsible for the onset of overflow metabolism.",
